Fixer : Nguyen Hai Duong
Mar 8 2017
=========================

Version 0.1 Mar 8 2017

ALl of function name and its functionality was copied from One Wire library for arduino and
it has been maintained by Paul Stoffregen (paul@pjrc.com) since January 2010. But, the content
inside functions are different.

I just call my self is "Fixer" because all of things I've done were copying and fixing.
